Adelson started his PhD in the Department of Instructional Technology of the University of Twente (the Netherlands) in 2020, supervised by Prof dr Ton de Jong, Prof dr Susan McKenney, and Dr Pantelis Papadopoulos.

In his doctoral studies, he aims to design and investigate conversational agents that support students talking productively in online science labs.

His bachelor was in Computer Engineering, and masters in Systems & Computing, both at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (Brazil). During his master's and bachelor's, he assisted the SmartMetropolis research group and published his first papers on international conferences. He had the opportunity to receive two research grants (2018 and 2019) from the Google LARA initiative (Latin America Research Awards) to support his project on predictive policing. He worked as a data engineer in the Public Ministry of Rio Grande do Norte, managing a data lake infrastructure and developing dashboards to help prosecutors analyze public budget-related issues.

His current research interests are conversational agents, collaborative learning, inquiry-based learning, and ethics in AI.
